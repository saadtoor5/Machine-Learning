# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning approach to predict stock closing prices using historical data. It uses a Linear Regression model to forecast future prices based on the date. The project is a beginner-friendly example of applying regression analysis to time-series-like financial data.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

- 📅 **Input**: Historical stock price data (Date and Close Price).
- 📊 **Model**: Linear Regression from `scikit-learn`.
- 📉 **Output**: Predicted closing price for any given date.

The core idea is to convert the dates into numerical values (ordinal format) so they can be used in a regression model. The model is then trained to find patterns in how stock prices change over time.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
   cd stock-price-prediction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   It’s recommended to use a virtual environment.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Add Your Dataset**
   Ensure your CSV file is named `stock_prices_500.csv` and contains at least the following columns:
   ```
   Date, Close
   ```

4. **Run the Script**
   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

5. **Interactive Prediction**
   After model training, you’ll be prompted to enter a date:
   ```
   Enter the date in the format YYYY-MM-DD:
   ```
   The script will output the predicted closing price for that date.

## 📌 Note

This project uses a very basic approach (linear regression on dates) and is not meant for real-world financial forecasting. It serves as an educational tool for understanding how regression can be applied to date-based data.
